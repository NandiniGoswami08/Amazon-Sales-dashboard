•	Sales Breakdown:  
1.	Product-wise sales analysis to identify top-performing products.
2.	City-wise and state-wise sales analysis for geographic insights.
3.	Region-based data classification (North, South, East, West).

•	Visualizations:
1.	Pie charts for percentage achievements.
2.	Bar charts for product-wise performance.
3.	Line charts for city-wise trends.
4.	A state-wise map for geographic distribution of sales.
